# Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a Sales Performance Dashboard in Power BI with a focus on KPI design, data modeling, and state-level performance analysis.

The objective was to evaluate business performance, identify regional differences, and assess customer value using calculated metrics rather than relying solely on absolute totals.

## Data Modeling

The dataset was structured at the state level and includes aggregated metrics:

- Total Revenue  
- Total Orders  
- Total Customers  

Custom DAX measures were implemented to calculate:

- Average Orders per Customer  
- Revenue per Customer  

---

## Key Performance Indicators

The dashboard includes the following KPIs:

- Total Revenue  
- Total Orders  
- Total Customers  
- Average Orders per Customer  

These indicators provide a high-level overview of overall business performance.

## Analytical Approach

The analysis distinguishes between volume-based and value-based performance.

Key insights:

- High total revenue may be driven by customer volume.
- Revenue per Customer highlights customer value.
- Average Orders per Customer reflects purchasing behavior differences.

This approach enables more accurate business evaluation and avoids misleading conclusions based solely on total revenue.
